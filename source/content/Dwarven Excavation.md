  - "[[Abathor]]"

The Dwarven Excavation is a shrine to [[Abathor]] and as such dwarves are not allowed in the ruinds

 Temple was abandoned but previously occupied by [[Abathor's Cult]]
 
- Powerful magic cast a few years ago
- The walls have a magical warping like in [[The Temple]] ([[Session 24#^5bdef9]])
- Everything is burnt to a crisp

The site is the home to a blood ritual that summons [[Bloodstone]] that [[Zorrithar]] has previously used to summon shadows and shadowy tendrils. The ritual was corrupted, assumedly by Zorathar to prevent another from gaining the gem. [[Abathor]] (probably) is also trapped in a statue surrounded by shadows.
