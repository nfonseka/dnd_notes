Gems potentially made by [[Triton]] as weapons.
- Triton's diadem does a thing

> [!Memory]
> Triton has a memory of Triton with all the gems in the diadem. He has just used it. There is a deep sense of regret and dread. There is something pushing into your mind and Triton's grip on reality is slipping.
> The memory feels fresh and painful as something digs into his mind. Triton activates the onyx and tries to erase your own memories and it fails again. The gems are designed so they can't be used against [[Triton]]. Triton hears footsteps and a dress appears in view; silken god that kneels down to match [[Triton]]'s eye level and it asks [[Triton]] in a quiet and calm but in a disconcerting tone and asks "Would you like to forget" . Their face is completely veiled wearing a black veil and Triton drops the diadem and grabbed the [[Shar]] hand. The thing pushing into [[Triton]]'s mind is pushed out.
