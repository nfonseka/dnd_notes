- GUNSHOTS from downstairs and then there is silence
- Small creature with red pants and a black boot goes into the oven
- This space is weirdly familiar but disconcerting
- building is a bit strange
- unsettling symbols
- Unnaturally fluttering thing
- Feels like we are trapped in our minds
- This space isn't real


Would your brother say this is the safe door

# Second Encounter
# The Mind Goblin

## Slippery Bastard

The Mind Goblin is immune to all control effects and can teleport to any point on the map. 

When the Mind Goblin takes direct damage from an attack or spell, or is restrained or grappled, he will use his reaction to teleport to the top of another random icy fingy.

## Sugary Shield

The Mind Goblin starts the fight with a Sugary Shield active. While the Sugary Shield is active he is resistant to all damage, has advantage on all saving throws, and is immune to all conditions.

## More Sweet Treats

When all Candy Cane Creatures have been slain or when most of the Candy Cane Creatures have been dead for one round, the Mind Goblin will teleport to the center of the map and attempt to summon more Candy Cane Creatures. It takes the Mind Goblin 1 round to complete the summoning. 

While he is summoning, the Mind Goblin loses his Sugary Shield, cannot act, and has disadvantage on all Dexterity and Strength saving throws. When he has completed his summoning, he will regain his Sugary Shield. Upon losing 50% of his maximum hit points while summoning, the Mind Goblin becomes immune to all damage and conditions until he completes his summoning. After completing the summoning, the Mind Goblin will teleport to the top of a random icy fingy. 

Each time the Mind Goblin summons more Candy Cane Creatures, the number of Candy Cane Creatures will increase. After resummoning Candy Cane Creatures 3 times the number of Candy Cane Creatures will become lethally overwhelming, but he will not regain Sugary Shield and loses the ability to teleport (Slippery Bastard).

## Sugar Rush

Each creature (Player) can have up to 5 stacks of Sugar Rush, gaining various, cumulative effects at each level of Sugar Rush. Each level of Sugar Rush grants the creature an additional 5 ft of movement speed and the following effects: 

1 stack: Can Disengage as a bonus action. If you could Disengage as a bonus action without this effect, gain the ability to Disengage without needing to use an action or bonus action. 
2 stacks: Gain advantage on all ability checks. 
3 stacks: Gain advantage on all saving throws. 
4 stacks: Gain advantage on all attacks and all saving throws enemies make that are caused by them are made with disadvantage. 
5 stacks: Enter a Glucoidal Rage until the end of their turn or until they reach 0 hit points. While in a Glucoidal Rage they gain an additional action, the ability to cast 2 spells of level 1 or higher in one turn, resistance to all damage, and critical hits on an attack roll of 19 or 20.

When a creature loses Glucoidal Rage, they lose all stacks of Sugar Rush, and Sugar Crash until the end of their next turn. Sugar Crashed creatures fall Unconscious and Prone and cannot be roused early. Unconscious creatures cannot gain any stacks of Sugar Rush.

## Loaded Arsenal
At the start of his turn the Mind Goblin changes guns, rotating between the same 3 guns and always in the same order. When he attacks he will only attack with his current gun.

The Mind Goblin has a different targeting priority with each gun:
Slug Shotgun - closest target

At the end of his turn, the Mind Goblin will select 3 random enemies. At the end of that enemy's turn, the Mind Goblin will make an attack with his legendary action, following the targeting priority of his currently equipped gun. If the target is under full cover from the Mind Goblin, the Mind Goblin will still fire the shot but it will hit the cover and the shot will have no effect.

## Mindless Constructs

Candy Cane Creatures are not capable of advanced tactics and will simply attack the closest enemy. A Candy Cane Creature can be taunted into attacking a specific player if the player makes a “deez nuts” joke that has not previously been made in the encounter,. A player may taunt a Candy Cane Creature once per turn without using an action or bonus action. Subsequent attempts to taunt a Candy Cane Creature require a bonus action, and then an action.
