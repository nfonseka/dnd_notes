- Paper that says greed is good

>[!note] Greed is Good
>In this mortal world we have only a single life
One destined to be filled with woe, misery, and strife
We offer blood, sweat, and, tears to build temples and reliefs
And we pray to the gods to deliver us from our griefs
Yet all of our efforts are hopelessly in vain
The price of our devotion is more suffering and pain
So if a life of piety will not give us what we need
Then we might as well indulge in glorious hedonism and greed
I choose to cast aside my pathetic life of old
My body will become a temple of good wine and gold
Your warnings and threats that the gods will make me pay
Ring hollow and empty on this new beautiful day
“Please save my soul” you will continue to cry
While I live a wonderful life completely hammered or high


>[!hint] Secret Message
>Offer your blood and all of your gold or pay the price with your body and your soul.
