- [[Yatar]] is Bane's City

Bane was a wholly malevolent and brutal deity that distanced himself from mere mortals, preferring to reign over his followers from afar. He savored the terror he instilled in others and the hatred that formed in mortals' hearts, utilizing this strife to gain greater control over the Realms. He embodied the principles of ambition and control and believed that the strong had not only the right, but the duty, to rule over the weak. He favored those with drive and courage, often aiding those who sought to establish order or conquer new territories. While he was seen as a savior in some regions, his teachings also led to dictatorships and the promotion of slavery. Upon consuming the Whiteheart Fruit, Glaedril saw a vision of Torm doing battle with Bane where they killed each other. After their fall, a mysterious figure cloaked in shadows was seen channeling dark magic before Bane's fallen body and saying in Infernal "Kere'vor Zakuum", "I accept this blessing".
