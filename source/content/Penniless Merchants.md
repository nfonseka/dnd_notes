The Penniless Merchants are Yartar's largest company. They own a diverse portfolio of other companies in Yartar and other major cities across Faerun.

### History

The company was founded by twin sisters Gemma and Lucille Silverhand. According to them, they were orphans who escaped their orphanage in the Feywild in their adolescence. Seeking a better life, they found their way to the Material Plane and the city of Yartar. Then starting with an apple they traded and bartered their way up into owning a fruit stall, which they then slowly expanded into Yartar's largest fruit supplier. Using their newfound wealth, they acquired a variety of businesses in and outside of Yartar that they successfully grew into large companies, establishing the Penniless Merchants as one of Faerun's largest and most influential companies.
