 At the start of combat, the Lightning Elemental creates 3 Lingering Currents in random spots within 5 ft of it. At the end of the Lighting Elemental's turn, it creates one Lingering Current on the ground in a random spot within 5 ft of it. Any creature that starts its turn within 5 ft of a Lingering Current must make a DEX saving throw (DC 17) or take 3 (1d6) lightning damage and gain a stack of Charged, creatures take half damage and gain no stacks of Charge on a successful save. Creatures can move through the Lingering Currents, but must make a DEX saving throw (DC 17) or take 3 (1d6) lightning damage and gain a stack of Charge. On a successful saving throw creatures take half damage, gain no stacks of Charge, and until the end of their turn they can move through any other Lingering Currents without taking damage or gaining stacks of Charge. Another creature may use their action to make a Sleight of Hand (DEX) check (DC 17) to dissipate the charge. If they fail to dissipate the Lingering Current, they take 3 (1d6) lightning damage and gain a stack of Charged. The Remove Curse and Dispel Magic spells can be used on a Lingering Current to dispel it.
