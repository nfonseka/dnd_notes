## Background
**Feature: False Identity**
You have created a second identity that includes documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona. Additionally, you can forge documents including official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the handwriting you are trying to copy.

## Backstory 
- Rathika was a groundskeeper for a rich family - became frail and weary and was also forced into maid duties
- Rani was Remi's big sister
- For unknown reason's around the time Remi was born, they were expelled from the house and forced to settle in beggars keep with whatever savings they had
- Rathika at this point was very old and was unable to work - She had only been raised for housework; no formal education but none of the other houses would take an old woman
- They settled by the river and everyday they would see the big buildings and lights and oftentimes they would even hear parties - if it was every lively enough. 
	- Remi and Rani hated this - they would be gouging themselves on wine and cheese while they would oftentimes go days without eating
- Rani was forced to care for the household. She would leave the house and come back at odd times stating that she was 'working' - Remi was too young to know what work she was doing. 
- One day Rani never came back and Remi was DISTRAUGHT 
- Remi, still a child, would venture into the streets everyday looking for Rani
- Remi would go to the guards but they never cared
- [[Rhettekest]] found Remi and Rathika - without Rani, they had no income and decided to take care of the family. He 'employed' remi
- but tbh it was mostly charity - they gave Remi, who was still a child at this time odd jobs around the [[Umbra of Raxes]] 
- Remi became a child of the village
- Even when Remi became older, [[Rhettekest]]  never really gave Remi 'real' jobs.

Remi never knew the family that banished them but Remi hated them, and the rest of the [[Neverwinter]] upper ruling class with a burning passion. Remi hated the city for abandoning them as they did other families and hated the system for the fact that once Rathika became less useful - she was as good as dead; and Remi hates the city for taken Rani, his only friend, from him so young.

The one thing Remi has love for - other than his mother and Rani - was [[Umbra of Raxes]] and the community in the Beggars Nest. Remi was a child of the village and respects the village for it. He has always known take care of yourself and your family, made or born into, because no-one else will.
