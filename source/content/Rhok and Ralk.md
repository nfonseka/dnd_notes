The largest mining company in Eastern Faerûn. Founded by two dwarven brothers Rhok and Ralk Rokorok, who recently sold the company to the Penniless Merchants for a sizeable fortune.

### Structure

The company previously exclusively run by dwarves, but after the acquisition by the Penniless Merchants, it underwent a nearly complete restructure. In its mines, the company now employs exclusively less intelligent dwarven miners, as hardier dwarven miners require fewer amenities and creature comforts to survive and thrive in the mines. Less intelligent dwarves are also less prone to complain about poor working conditions and form unions. To compensate for the lower mental aptitude of its rank and file miners, every mine is assigned one highly intelligent and capable overseer. These overseers must be dwarves to easily gain the trust and respect of the dwarven miners they are to lead, and they must undergo a number of tests to ensure their loyalty lies firmly with the company. Administrative tasks are often handled almost exclusively by non-dwarves, who are less likely to sympathise with the poor working conditions that the dwarven miners are exposed to. Most of the company's office workers are not even aware of the squalid conditions that the miners work under.
