The Shields of [Yartar](https://www.worldanvil.com/w/sword-coast-voldaren/a/yartar-settlement) is a group of mounted soldiers that defended the city of Yartar. They also served as the military government of Yartar. In defense of the city, the Shields were often forced to drive off monstrous raiders, such as bands of orcs and groups of trolls. There are rumours that some of the largest companies in Yartar have militias larger than the Shields.

### Structure

The Waterbaron of Yartar serves as the Shields' highest-ranking commander. They are served by a number of officers known as Overswords. The Shields of Yartar are divided into 5 arms, with each arm consisting of roughly 100 people.

### History

Yartar has never been involved in any major wars so the Shields have never been tested in all out war.
