Tell me about the blood gem

##### assistant
Based on your notes, here's what I've gathered about the Blood Gem:
**Type:** The Blood Gem is a Blood Gem, similar to another one mentioned in your notes.
**Origin:** It was obtained from a Dwarven Excavation, which was likely a site where a blood ritual was performed to summon the gem.
**Corrupted Version:** There is a corrupted version of the Blood Gem that Zorathar has, which is likely the result of the ritual being corrupted by Zorathar himself.
**Properties:** The Blood Gem asks the wielder "What weapon do you desire" or something similar, suggesting that it has a mind of its own or is imbued with some kind of magical properties.
**Connection to Zorathar:** The Blood Gem is closely tied to Zorathar, who has used it to summon shadows and shadowy tendrils. It's likely that Zorathar has a significant attachment to the gem and may be using it for his own purposes.
**Other Notes:** The Blood Gem is also connected to a Blood Monster, which was summoned by the ritual and left behind a corrupted version of the gem.

I didn't find any information about Triton's Gem in your previous notes. It's possible that this is a new note or information that hasn't been added to the existing notes yet.

However, I did find a note about Triton, which mentions that he is a character who has a gem, but it doesn't specify what kind of gem or what its properties are.

If you have any additional notes about Triton's Gem, I'd be happy to help you summarize that information as well!
