Last Entry (Dated to the night he died):
>“After four restless days and nights of traversing half-waking dreams and flickering threads of fate, it is clear to me that [[The Weave]] has ruptured, and something powerful has taken advantage of this damage to obscure the [[Grand Tapestry of Destiny]]. I am not sure what magic comprises this repressive shroud or who wields such heinous sorcery, but I know they conceal the truth. The truth of the gods disappearing, the truth of [[The Severance between Holy Men and Women]] and their connections to the divine, the truth of the withering of magic and the illness of the Weave. If the enemies of truth work against us, then it is my duty as Loremaster of Oghma to uncover their schemes and put an end to their maleficence. I can no longer afford to be cautious. Even though the fruit is not fully grown, even though [[Selune]] will not answer my prayers, even though I risk my own demise by the very [[Heart of the Moon]], the enemies of verity cannot be allowed to continue desecrating the very fabric of arcane magic. I will deliver [[Tonight’s Covenant]] and inform the clergy of my intentions, and my potential quietus from this ever eventful mortal existence. Regardless of what may transpire, I have faith that the shadow of deceit and malice will be vanquished in the unfaltering light of the truth. It must be.”

The previous entries are almost incoherent babble
