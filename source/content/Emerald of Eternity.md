A vibrant green emerald that radiates with power. Can be used as a spellcasting focus. Grants +3 to AC and saving throws. During a long rest, you may embed the Emerald into a set of armour. As an action, you may magically store that set of armour in the Emerald, causing the armour to disappear but the Emerald to remain. You may then use a bonus action to magically resummon the stored armour set, either worn or separate from your person. Has 9 charges which are replenished after a long rest. Charges can be expended to cast certain protective and defensive spells, charges are expended equal to the level of the spell cast.
